# Extending Unity Test Framework
It is possible to extend the Unity Test Framework (UTF) in many ways, for custom workflows for your projects and for other packages to build on top of UTF.

These extensions are a supplement to the ones already offered by [NUnit](https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Framework-Extensibility).

Some workflows for extending UTF include:
* [How to split the build and run process for standalone Play Mode tests](./reference-attribute-testplayerbuildmodifier.md#split-build-and-run-for-player-mode-tests)
* [How to run tests programmatically](./extension-run-tests.md)
* [How to get test results](./extension-get-test-results.md)
* [How to retrieve the list of tests](./extension-retrieve-test-list.md)
